First DIY gig in many years. In classic DIY form, we got there about 30 minutes before we were scheduled to play, and we walked around to the back yard of the house where the performance area was, and there was a half-assembled PA system with unnecessarily large speakers, a partial drum kit, and a small group of starry-eyed, tipsy hipsters meandering. There was also a rusted-out old Honda motorcycle siting in the background in front of the coach house, lending cool vibe to the place.

It was a bit of an odd performance because it was just me, Lee, and Steve out there (no drummer), so everything felt kind of naked. But it was fun nonetheless. Glad to see there's still some life in this old town's DIY circuit.
