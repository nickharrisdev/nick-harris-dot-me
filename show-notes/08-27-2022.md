Festivals are a great type of gig sometimes. Guaranteed pay, built-in audience with at least a high percentage of people who have never heard your music before, playing outside in the sunshine. Not too shabby. Everyone at this one was super nice. I sang my old smash hit song 'Have You Thought About Me Lately??' for the first time live in quite a while. Kit played with us for the first time. We did a couple of Steve Slagg songs. All in all good times!
