I played at the Golden Dagger (formerly Tonic Room) for Lee Ketch's solo album release last night and had the pleasure of hearing DPCD open. I had never heard them before, but can now say I'm a fan. Alec Watson's gentle, breathy vocals, finger-plucked acoustic guitars, and the lilting melodies of his songs drew a direct line in my mind to artists like Sufjan Stevens and Nick Drake. The band also made use of an actual, mid-century-era acoustic celesta (Jenco brand, portable version seen in the image above), an instrument I had never seen or heard performed live before. It was a gorgeous accompaniment to the guitars and vocal harmonies.

When I got home after the show, I looked up some of his recordings and found this gem of a record "DPCD Sings". It is an homage to the Great American Songbook, and it's almost eerie how these recordings and tunes sound like they come from another time, decades ago.
