    description: "Not exactly rocknroll. But this song from Wicked kind of struck me the other day. It stood out for whatever reason. Maybe it made me feel something... Anyway, I think I may be the only person in the world to connect Elfaba's storyline with that of Larry David in the show Curb Your Enthusiasm. They are both so righteous, trying their best to do good, only to have it misconstrued and turned around on them. Cue the Curb theme."

Over the course of the last week I saw Alvvays, Lizzo, and Wicked (the musical). #Blessed. This is my favorite Lizzo song and I got to hear it live in person on Sunday 🙌🏻.
