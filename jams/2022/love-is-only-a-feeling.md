I recorded bass for my good friend [Steve Slagg](https://steveslagg.bandcamp.com/music)'s album last weekend and somehow this Darkness record came up, and was vehemently recommended to me. I had heard the hit 'I Believe in a Thing Called Love', but had never checked out the entire record until now. This song really hit me. In particular, the way the intro part transititions instantly and seamlessly from plodding and heavy-as-hell to the verse which is completely the opposite - ethereal and bright, blows my little mind.

I also appreciate how this band shamelessly, joyfully embraces the most over-the-top, excesses of late-70s glam and classic rock -- from the extremely high pitched male vocal and guitarmony solos to the long hair and flowy unbuttoned shirts, Les Pauls, etc. I'm a sucker for this kind of music... I guess the teenager in me still just wants to rock.
