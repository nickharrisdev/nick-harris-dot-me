Somehow Prince and Tom Petty are linked in my mind. Possibly because they are two arists that I got into around college age, both had long, storied careers, and arguably peaked in the 80s. And both died around the same time, before their time, and due to overdoses from prescription opioids. After going to the Prince Immersive Exhibit this week and revisiting his catalogue, I did the same for Petty, and dug up this old treasure from 1999's Echo. So simple and so powerful, like much of his oeuvre.
