    description: "Thank god for bandcamp. I find the most interesting, awesome music on there that I would otherwise have no idea existed. Apparently I came across Graham Hunt on BC and subscribed to get updates about his releases at some point in my past (I have no memory of doing so). I got notified about this siq, power-pop, 90s throwback release the other week and it has been on heavy rotation ever since."

    description: "This song came on the radio in the car ride to a band practice recently. It's such a particular, slightly obscure nugget of a song that's usually dramatically overshadowed by the big hit Don't Dream It's Over from the same album, and it's weird that it would just casually come on the radio. Had to share."

A relatable new jam for you this week dear reader. The lack of privacy that comes with being famous would suck. Everything else that comes with it though? 'Gimme!' as NNAMDÏ says in this goofy banger. Looking forward to this album coming out this fall.
