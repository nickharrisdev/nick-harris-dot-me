I got a chance to see Another Michael (whom I had never heard before) open for Christian Lee Hutson at Schuba's. This is their latest single. Pretty chill! I ran into a friend after their set, and he was talking to his friend, the lead singer (Michael). I was surprised to learn that they were touring with one less person than usual, playing all of their songs as a three-piece instead of four. It still sounded good to me - intentionally stripped down or something, almost Neil Young-ish, but after hearing all the big, lush harmonies on the recordings, I can see where that 4th musician would fit into the mix.

Christian Lee Hutson had a pretty awesome set. He had a great sense of humor on stage too, extremely deadpan, which I guess was to be expected considering the lyrical content of some of his songs. "Smooth" by Rob Thomas and Santana played as the band walked out on stage, which was already goofy, but then they kicked into their first song, and it was........... a cover of "Smooth" by Rob Thomas and Santana. A good gag! It was super hot that night, and I kind of think they just wanted to start the set by singing "It was a hot one".
