    description: "The Rubs were one of the best bands to emerge from the mid 2010s Chicago DIY punk scene and even played in my basement (aka Club Soda, the now defunct venue) at one point in 2015. Their last album 'Impossible Dream' is one of my all time faves, and they finally put out a follow up earlier this year in July, but somehow I slept on it. This is one of my favorites from the new one."

I heard a brief, sped up clip of this song at the very end of the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXeItLWppW8) for a movie called "Leonor Will Never Die" a couple two tree weeks ago at the Music Box. I went on a little bit of a journey down the internet rabbit hole to identify the song only to return to the trailer on youtube this week to see that I had overlooked a comment in which someone mentioned the song title ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è So glad I found it so I can enjoy it in its entirety whenever I want. That main riff is unforgettably badass.
