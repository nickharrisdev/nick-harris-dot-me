An Uber I was riding in this week had the radio tuned to [87.7 MeTV FM](https://metv.fm/), a Chicago station that plays easy-listening oldies and soft rock from the 60s-90s. It triggered memories of listening to MeTV a few years ago with my old roommates through a busted combination radio/tape/record player in our kitchen, rocking out to classics by The Carpenters, ABBA, and Bread, and discovering some new (to us) jams along the way (sandwiched between ads clearly directed at the post-retirement age demographic).

Last night, I put MeTV on to keep us company while doing the dull, physical chore of repainting my bedroom with my girlfriend, and it turned up this cheesy yet weirdly energizing soft rock jam from the 80s. Rip that sax!!!
