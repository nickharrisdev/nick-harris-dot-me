    description: "Came across this fellow this year. His most recent album is so reminiscent of some of my favorite output by Guided By Voices. This song is an absolute gem that I could listen to about a million times and still not get sick of it. Perfection."

This is my favorite track from the new Alex G. He has struck gold again.
