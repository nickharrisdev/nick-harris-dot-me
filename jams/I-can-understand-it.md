Village Discount Outlet (Chicago based thrift store chain) always has something interesting playing on the in-store sound system between ads and shopper updates. I was wandering around the aisles of the Andersonville branch this week when I heard Bobby Womack's cover of Sweet Caroline pop on, and having never heard it before, I was inspired to check out the album it was originally released on (Understanding, 1972) when I got home later. 

That's when I found this emotional, kind of proto-disco track. Classic example of Bobby's ripping vocals, and I love how the main verse beat substitutes the snare on the 2s and 4s with a loud high-hat. Fun stuff! üï∫üèª
