I watched Practical Magic on Halloween, and this song plays over the closing credits. I think Stevie Nicks was involved somehow in curating the soundtrack, which is actually pretty choice. Fun movie, and really groovy track that stands among some of the best in Stevie's catalogue. Also happens to feature Sheryl Crow.
