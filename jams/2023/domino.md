    description: "Went to the Music Box over the weekend to check out 'Asteroid City', the new movie from Wes Anderson. Before the movie started, the house organist, Dennis Scott, played a set of songs (including this one) from 1955, the year the film is set. Always a treat to hear this fella jam out on such a unique instrument!!!"
