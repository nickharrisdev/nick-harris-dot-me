Paul Cherry has returned with a new album. This one has been on heavy rotation this week and extremely stuck in my head. Very relatable for me as one who has been back on and off the music over the years. Now LA-based, Cherry returns to his old stomping grounds (here - Chicago) tomorrow, playing at Lincoln Hall. I just might check it out!
