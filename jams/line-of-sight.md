    description: "My good friend Lee played this for me in the car on the way home from band practice. Classic way to find new tunes. So simple and powerful. This is the type of stuff that makes me want to make music. It's an original, but to me, sounds like a punk band covering a classic lost Motown single."

If you're a fan of the last Waxahatchee album St. Cloud (and I am), you will not be disappointed by Katie Crutchfield's latest project. She has the extremely rare ability to make songs that are so familiar, they sound like something off of classic rock radio, recording in the 1970s, but no. It's new music from 2022.
