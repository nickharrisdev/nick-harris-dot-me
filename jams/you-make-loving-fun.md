I've always thought Christine McVie is low key the best songwriter of Fleetwood Mac. And this might as well be Exhibit A. I had to give this song a close listen this week for the first time in a while, because I'm going to play it at a wedding with some friends this summer. And the detailed, precision and just perfection of the production (especially those background vocals) knocked me out.
