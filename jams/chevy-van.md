    description: "Elliott Smith's catalogue is such a perfect match for the Autumn aura - brisk air, golden, angled light from the southern skies, leaves falling, etc, etc. All the fall things. This is a deep-ish cut from Figure 8 that I missed previously. The guitar work, melodies and lyrics are just ü§åüèª perfect."

Something I've realized as this list of weekly songs has come together is that I get a lot of music recommendations and exposure to music I've never heard before on the way to and from band practice, shows, and generally when I'm in the car with other musicians.

That's how I ended up hearing this now-obscure 70s middling hit, a novelty song by (a name that sounds like something made up for an SNL sketch), Sammy Johns about 'making love in my Chevy Van'. That's literally it. It was spread by word of mouth - the guy fixing my friend's guitar mentioned it, and my friend played it in the car with me. Apparently it inspired a [1977 film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsV48ReyKoo) featuring Danny DeVito. Easy listening, and a good laugh.
