I was on the Red Line at some point this week thinking about how Jack White is coming out with a new record and was reflecting on the different phases of his career and how they align with phases of my life when I was into his music to varying degrees, and I remembered Alison Mosshart from The Dead Weather. THEN I remembered this song from her other band The Kills, which is arguably more interesting than The Dead Weather. And so here we are.

Anyway, this song has a gorgeous, weird, ramshackle, kind of Stonesy, kind of Velvet Underground vibe. I love it and love the video.
