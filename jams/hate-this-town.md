    description: "I had to throw a Christmas song on the Christmas Eve post. This song I think comes as close as you can get to perfectly capturing the complicated mix of emotions that can come with the holiday season -- mostly nostalgia, sense of time passing, sadness and longing for the past, etc. So good. The rest of the song conveys the joy, excitement, warmth and familiarity of Christmas too."

End-of-year recap/best-of lists get too much hate. I get that they fall into the much maligned category of 'listicle', but it can be a really good way to look back and maybe find something you missed that came out months before. I found this song on [a list of the best "Country" of 2022 on Bandcamp](https://daily.bandcamp.com/best-of-2022/the-best-country-of-2022), and went on to check out the rest of the album, and it's pretty fantastic. Really love the raw, realistic descriptions of dive bars in small towns in Buckley's lyrics, and the quietly sad vibe they give off.
