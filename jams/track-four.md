    description: "I got some new desktop speakers this week. They're my first sort-of-nice speakers that I've ever owned, so I've been having fun going through some old favorite tracks and testing them out. The whole 'Siamese Dream' record sounds incredible and in particular the dense, bone dry distortion of the guitars feels like an inner ear massage through a hi-fi sound system ðŸ¤¤ ðŸŽ¸"

This fella Nate Amos used to haunt the Chicago scene before moving out to NYC and setting up shop there. He puts out an incredible amount of tuneage and somehow walks the tightrope of casual, slacker-y punk rock sound experiments and meticulously crafted, well-produced pop songs. 'This Is Lorelei' is the name for his solo productions/releases, so it's 'not a real band.' This track is a recent favorite. Is it worth mentioning the irony that 'Track Four' is track five?
