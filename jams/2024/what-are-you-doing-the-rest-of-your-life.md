I found this rendition on a user-made Spotify playlist titled "Very sad jazz playlist (very f-ing sad)" because that is sometimes where you find yourself scrolling late on a Tuesday night in February. There are so few piano players who have the kind of sublime touch and feel that Bill Evans did. Grateful recordings like this exist.
