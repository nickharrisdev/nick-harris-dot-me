    description: "I hate to give Spotify any credit for anything regarding music curation - I just don't think that it can be truly well-done algorithically. In fact, what it's mostly good for is reminding me of older songs that I have already listened to a bunch of times but just haven't revisted in a while. This, my friend, is one of those tracks. A perfectly written and arranged song. It's also one of those songs where they tack a little almost musically unrelated coda at the very end, as if the song was already packed enough with pretty little melodies and hooks and changes. It's like a little easter egg at the end - your reward for making it this far."

The new song from Aaron Lee Tasjan, one of my favorite songwriters and musicians out there. He has had such prolific and consistently good output across his career, which is something that is kinda rare and hard to maintain.

There's so many good lines in this song, but this is my favorite -- "We all want something real and only tremble in its shadow"
