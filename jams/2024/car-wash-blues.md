I don't know how I ended up going down a Jim Croce rabbit hole this week. I might've heard one his songs when I was listening to MeTV FM the other day putting together some Ikea furniture. Regardless... in a JC rabbit hole on Spotify is where I heard this song. He was such a great writer -- so many of his songs are these sort of blue-collar 'character' songs. Always in third person, sometimes using specific names (Jim Walker, Leroy Brown, Rapid Roy, Speedball Tucker), and the sensory details he uses in the lyrics make it all seem real and authentic. The similarities between the songs make it feel like a little world, where you could imagine these characters living and interacting. Usually there's a dash of good humor and a solid grooving backbeat too.
