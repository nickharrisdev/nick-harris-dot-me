    description: "I was Bandcamp browsing again this morning, and stumbled across Jim O'Rourke, a former Wilco collaborator and Chicago ex-pat of whose songs I know a few (is that a sentence?)... but I've never really dug into his material, partly because he has taken it down from all the streaming sites and Youtubez. He's an elusive one. I have that feeling of anticipation that comes right before diving deep into an artist's oeuvre and FEASTING."

I only know about Jon Brion because of the covers album that [Mo Troper](https://motroper.bandcamp.com/album/troper-sings-brion) released at the end of last year. But since I learned of his existence I've spent alot of time listening to these tracks. Brion has a [treasure trove of amazing demos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8eMVxqHD-k) recorded in the mid 90s that have never gotten a proper release, including this gem.
