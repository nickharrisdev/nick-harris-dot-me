[Bandcamp Friday](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-fridays-in-2024) (where Bandcamp waives their revenue share and passes the funds directly to artists and labels) for April 2024 was yesterday. Here is what I picked up.

Preordered this new album ['Way To Be' by youbet](https://youbetband.bandcamp.com/album/way-to-be) (which the song Carsick linked below is from). Loving the sounds and melodies and everything I've heard so far. Check it out!
