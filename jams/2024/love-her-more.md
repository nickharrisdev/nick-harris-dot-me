This new Lemon Twigs record might be their best yet if the singles are any indication. I love this band. Can't wait to see them effortlesly blast through this incredibly intricate song live next time they're in Chicago.

A wealth of great music came out on Friday and I'm still catching up. Aaron Lee Tasjan's new album [Stellar Evolution](https://altobviously.bandcamp.com/album/stellar-evolution), a [new single from Youbet](https://youbetband.bandcamp.com/track/nurture), [Tigers Blood](https://waxahatchee.bandcamp.com/album/tigers-blood) the new Waxahatchee record, new [Khruangbin](https://khruangbin.bandcamp.com/album/a-la-sala), and new ones from Maggie Rogers and Vampire Weekend. And Neil Young put his music back on Spotify recently. Things are looking up!
