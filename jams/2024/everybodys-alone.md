I was supposed to see Neil Young and Crazy Horse play at Northerly Island a couple weeks ago, but the show was postponed at the very last second due to some unexplained illness. No word yet when it will be rescheduled.

I guess if I was to really dig for a silver lining it's that I was motivated by anticipation of the show to go back and dive into Neil's catalog to listen to old favorites and search for hidden gems. And in doing so came across this one off an upcoming release of old rarities. So good!
