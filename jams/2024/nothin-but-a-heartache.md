I came across this excellent Michael McDonald song during a Doobie Brothers deep dive that was triggered by listening to their record 'Minute by Minute' on my sister's 1960s-era record player console around the holidays. I died and was reborn when I heard the vocal harmonies come in on the second chorus on my first listen-through (of MANY). Can't believe I missed this track until now! Happy new year indeed.
