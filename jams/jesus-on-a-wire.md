    description: "I feel obligated to share this here because I have been humming and singing the line 'If you give a little more then you're asking for / your love will turn the key' repeatedly for the last week or so. I don't know what it means but it's catchy as hell."

Amid the deluge of new music (it feels like it's been a lot but maybe that's just me) coming out in the last few weeks, Kurt Vile's record '(watch my moves)' has had me returning for repeat listens. Maybe it's the weather heating up and summer lethargy setting in.

His lyrics strike a balance between humor and beauty that's hard to achieve, and manage to evoke the anxiety of existing today. Cate LeBon's background vocals are a perfect touch. And the classic laid back KV grooviness and production make this one a stone cold chiller ðŸ˜´
