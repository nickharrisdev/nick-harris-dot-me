This new Alvvays record and the corresponding response and fanfare has really reawakened my love of powerpop. I was so struck by this album the first time I listened to it Friday, I immediately looked up when they play in Chicago, and found out they're here next week at the Riviera, just down the street from me. And I got tickets. It's the first time I've ever done that.

This song in particular stood out to me. So powerful yet so short. Incredibly memorable. That's one sign of a truly classic song - when you listen to it one time and it's immediately unforgettable. Also - shout out to the big, emotional key change there toward the end. Gotta love it.

"I'll egress to Inverness" - favorite line. I had to look up both of these words.
