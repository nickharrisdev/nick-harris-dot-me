    description: "I checked out the Shania Twain doc on a lark and ended up revisiting some of the lesser known cuts from 'Come On Over', an album that I was already pretty familiar with just due to being alive with working ears in the 90s, but had never revisited as an adult (and post musical awakening). Just a flawless recording on all the levels. It's inspiring when people put so much effort and attention to every granular detail into crafting a recording AND it turns out to be a hit that is nearly universally appreciated and understood."

Nate Amos just keeps giving us great music. I love the laid back feel of this track. And the off-the-cuff vibe (even though it's usually a sneakily detailed and careful production with This Is Lorelei) and authenticity. Makes me want to keep making and putting out music.
