    description: "The other week was Rheaply's  'All hands' week, where the entire company convenes in Chicago and we work together in the office all week long (and go to after-hours events every night ðŸ˜…). One of my co-workers who's also a music journalist on the side introduced me to this killer track and artist and the idea of IDM (intellectual dance music). Good stuff!"

BeyoncÃ© is one of few remaining artists that can drop a new album that instantly becomes omnipresent, and is nearly universally loved. Since this record came out, I've been hearing it in cars driving by my apartment, walking to the train, drifting through the park when I'm out sitting by the lake soaking up some rays. You just can't escape it. Anyway, this is my favorite song I've heard so far from the album. I really like the line "This kind of love / Big business" for some reason. Is she talking about her and Jay-z? What does it say about capitalism? I may never know, but it's provacative nonetheless.
